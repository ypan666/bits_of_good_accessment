## My Introduction Card - Take Home Assessment

This repository contains the code for a simple "Introduction Card" web page, created as a take-home assessment for Bits of Good.

**Features:**

* Displays your name, major, year, passion for social good (optional), and hometown (optional).
* Includes a profile picture.
* A "Learn More" button redirects you to a separate page with additional information (optional).

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Replace Placeholder Content:**
    * Replace `my_photo.jpg` with the path to your own profile picture.
    * Update the information in the `index.html` file with your details (name, major, year, passion, and hometown).

3. **Run the Project:**
    * Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view your introduction card.

**Optional: "Learn More" Functionality**

This project includes optional JavaScript code that adds a "Learn More" button. Clicking this button will redirect you to another page (`more.html`). You can customize this functionality by:

* Modifying the redirect URL in `script.js`.
* Adding content to the `more.html` file.


I hope this README provides a clear overview of the project. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your preferences!
